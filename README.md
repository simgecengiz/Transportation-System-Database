# Transportation-System-Database
 ER/EER Diagram and SQL codes about Transportation System

In this project, it is requested to develop a transportation database model in which different transportation alternatives for a country (sea, air, road, mobile transportation, metro, etc.) are recorded at macro and micro levels. In this system, transportation will be provided with a unique card for each citizen. Citizens' transportation histories, searches and preferences will be recorded. In order to realise this project, different transport types and requirements were analysed. For example, obilet, thy, izban and similar transport routes were analysed. As a result of these analyses, ER diagrams were drawn and integrated into the whole system as EER. After these analyses, SQL codes were written on SQL Server Management Studio to implement the database. Related ER diagrams, EER diagram of the whole system are attached below.SQL codes attached in file.

This project was the term project of the Introduction to Database course at Ege University. It was designed together with teammates.
